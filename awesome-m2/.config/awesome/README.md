## File Structure
+ `config`: Everything that can be customized is here (programs used, value for monitoring, text icons, etc...).
+ `daemons`: Contains all tasks launched in the background, track cpu usage, network, volume, etc... and emit a signal used by widgets. Daemons are used for display notifications too. Many codes comes from the [vicious lib](https://github.com/vicious-widgets/vicious).
+ `icons`: Default icons used by all themes and all widgets.
+ `layouts`: Extra layouts displayed in awesome like `monitor_bar`, `start_screen`, `logout`, etc...
+ `modules`: Modules is the default file [rc.lua](https://awesomewm.org/doc/api/sample%20files/rc.lua.html) splited and arrange into several files, you can found keybinds, signals, etc... and their configurations.
+ `titlebars`: Code to create differents titlebars or to hide them.
+ `utils`: Contains all the reuse code, functions, etc... 
+ `widgets`: All widgets here, each widget are customizable and have multiple forms (text, slider, horizontal bar, ...), i reuse same component for all forms.

## Configuration
One thing can be required, you have to copied the file `config/env.lua.sample`.

    $ cp ~/.config/awesome/config/env.lua.sample ~/.config/awesome/config/env.lua

+ `sound_system` `alsa` or `pulse`.
+ `network_card` to be monitored, the default is `lo`.

The file should be enought documented to fill the rest, post an issue if not.  

## Hotkeys
Hotkeys are a mix between all wm i have used during years, few one come from i3, dwm, subtle, monsterwm, awesome... but i have tried to keep the main from [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm/blob/master/examples/sxhkdrc). 
You can see all shortcuts with a right click on the desktop and select `awesome->hotkeys`.

##### Excerpt of some hotkeys i use
+ `super + enter` - Spawn terminal
+ `super + [1-0]` - View tag AKA change workspace (for you i3 folks)
+ `super + z` - Kill a client
+ `super + tab` - Focus the last tag/desktop (like dwm).
+ `super + {h,j,k,l}` - focus in a given direction.

##### Move/Resize
+ `super + alt + {h,j,k,l}` - Resize a window/client.

##### Extra Layouts
+ `super + Echap` - Display the logout screen.
+ `super + F1` - Display or toggle the `start_screen`.
+ `super + F4` - Display or toggle the `monitor_bar`.
